### Problem
181 Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
     
| Column Name | Type    |
|--------------|-------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.

Write a solution to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

### Thinking

1. 比對同張表的 id 與 manger.id (找出對應的 manager)
2. 比對薪資取出員工名字

### Code
```SQL
SELECT e2.name as Employee
FROM Employee e1
LEFT JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.id = e2.managerId
WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary
```
